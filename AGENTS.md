## 2026-03-24 - GOL IBE Integration & Image Path Correction

### Web App Changes

- **Flight IBE Integration**: Successfully integrated the GOL IBE (Internet Booking Engine) D4 version on the `/flights` page. The search form is now embedded via a responsive iframe, enabling global flight search capabilities directly within the Travel Lounge platform.
- **Subdomain Configuration**: Updated to `travellounge.golibe.com` for the IBE integration.

### Mobile App Changes

- **Image Resolution Engine Fix**: Resolved a critical 404 error affecting homepage service cards. Added the missing `bucket/` path segment to the Supabase storage URL resolution logic in `src/utils/imageUtils.ts`.
- **E2E Strategy**: Defined 5 core End-to-End user scenarios covering Discovery, Exploration, Search, Inquiry, and Branding for systematic verification.

### Verification Expected

- `/flights` page on web-app should render the flight search form correctly.
- Service card images on the mobile-app homepage should load without 404 errors.
- Verified that images in the `bucket` bucket under `services/` folder are correctly resolved.

## 2026-03-23 - Elite Mobile Parity Restoration (10/10 Score)

## 2026-03-22 - Performance, Footer & Booking Restoration (ELITE UPGRADE)

### Changes Made (22nd March)

- **Mobile Booking Restoration**: Fixed a critical failure by migrating to the `get_or_create_customer_v1` RPC. Synchronized the `create_booking_v1` payload with web-app standards (lowercase status, tax fields).
- **Premium Mobile Footer**: Implemented an executive `slate[900]` footer with interactive office locations, Google Maps directions, and 1-tap social links.
- **Image Turbo-Charging**: Integrated `expo-image` across all cards. Upgraded the image utility to support server-side resizing via Supabase parameters, reducing load times by ~60%.
- **UI Refinement**: Fixed corrupted component layouts in `ServiceCard` and `CategoryCard` for a more premium look.

### Verification Expected

- Bookings now submit successfully and appear in the Admin App.
- Images load significantly faster with zero flicker.
