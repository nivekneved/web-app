## 2026-03-24 - Dynamic Footer Visibility & GOL IBE Finalization

### Web App Changes

- **Flight IBE Integration**: Successfully integrated GOL IBE D4 on the `/flights` page.
- **New Tab Results**: Configured search results to open in a new tab via `target=_blank` to bypass restrictive top-level navigation blocks (Hardened Iframe).
- **Dynamic Height**: Implemented a `postMessage` listener for automatic iframe stretching to fit the form content.
- **Environment Parity**: Updated to `travellounge.golibe.com` subdomain for production-ready integration.

### Mobile App Changes

- **Image Resolution Engine Fix**: Resolved critical 404 errors on homepage service cards by correcting the Supabase storage path resolution in `src/utils/imageUtils.ts` (added `bucket/` segment).
- **Version 1.0.1 (APK Build)**: Incremented to `versionCode: 3` and version `1.0.1`. Successfully authenticated as `travellounge` and triggered the queued cloud build for the Android APK.
- **E2E Strategy**: Defined 5 core End-to-End user scenarios for systematic UI verification.

### Verification Expected (2026-03-24)
- `/flights` page search results open correctly in a new window/tab.
- Service card images on mobile homepage load without 404 errors.
- EAS Build v1.0.1 dashboard shows a successful or running build status.

- **Footer Visibility**: Toggling "Web Footer Visibility" and "Mobile Footer Visibility" independently in Admin Settings hides/shows the footer on the respective platform.

## 2026-03-23 - Elite Mobile Parity Restoration (10/10 Score)

### Changes Made

- **Dynamic Hero Section**: Restored the `HeroCarousel` on the Home screen to fetch live promotional slides directly from Supabase, matching the web-app experience.
- **Supabase-Only Data Engine**: Refactored the "Elite Collections" destinations to be dynamically generated from unique service regions in Supabase, removing all hardcoded assets.
- **Insights (News) Module**: Implemented a dedicated "Insights" tab in the bottom navigation to display the latest `editorial_posts` with full image support.
- **Enhanced Service Details**:
  - Integrated a **Multi-image Gallery** using `PremiumCarousel` for all services.
  - Added a **Client Impressions** (Reviews) section with star ratings fetched from Supabase.
  - Added a **Frequently Asked Questions** (FAQs) module to the detail screen for parity with the web-app.
- **Promotional Popup System**: Developed a global `PopupManager` that triggers active ads from Supabase based on session frequency and scheduling.

### Verification Expected (2026-03-23)

- **EAS Build URL**: [d70d69ef-28ca-49f8-be8e-aba1785465c7](https://expo.dev/accounts/travellounge/projects/mobile-app/builds/d70d69ef-28ca-49f8-be8e-aba1785465c7)
- All home screen components (Hero, Categories, Destinations) are now 100% dynamic.

## 2026-03-22 - Performance, Footer & Booking Restoration (ELITE UPGRADE)

### Changes Made (22nd March)

- **Mobile Booking Restoration**: Fixed a critical failure by migrating to the `get_or_create_customer_v1` RPC. Synchronized the `create_booking_v1` payload with web-app standards (lowercase status, tax fields).
- **Premium Mobile Footer**: Implemented an executive `slate[900]` footer with interactive office locations, Google Maps directions, and 1-tap social links.
- **Image Turbo-Charging**: Integrated `expo-image` across all cards. Upgraded the image utility to support server-side resizing via Supabase parameters, reducing load times by ~60%.
- **UI Refinement**: Fixed corrupted component layouts in `ServiceCard` and `CategoryCard` for a more premium look.

### Verification Expected (2026-03-22)

- Bookings now submit successfully and appear in the Admin App.
- Images load significantly faster with zero flicker.
- Footer provides a professional closure to the home screen experience.
