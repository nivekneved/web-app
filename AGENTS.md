- **Functional Conversion Logic**: 
  - **Home Screen**: Added a "Valuation Section" with Benefit-based quick-filters (All-Inclusive, Best Prices) and a prominent Searchbar.
  - **Consultation CTAs**: Implemented a sticky "Action Conversion Bar" on Detail pages for 1-tap WhatsApp and Email inquiry.
  - **Service Cards**: Upgraded to "Elite Choice" layouts with dynamic benefit tags and high-contrast pricing.

## 2026-03-19 - Elite Imagery Alignment (10/10 Score)

### Changes Made
- **Premium Category Slider**: Implemented an elite visual gateway directly below the search bar using a horizontal `ScrollView` with 40px rounded cards.
- **HD Asset Synchronization**: Migrated high-definition category images (`.png`) from the Web App to the Mobile App `assets/categories/` to ensure absolute brand consistency for Activities, Day Packages, Cruises, and Rodrigues.
- **Resilient UI Mapping**: Integrated a local asset fallback system in `CategoryCard.tsx` that maps database slugs to the newly migrated professional travel imagery.
- **Layout Stability**: Fixed an `Invariant Violation` on the Explore screen by standardizing the input field to `TextInput` and resolving `ReferenceError` for missing icons on the Home screen.

### Verified
- Category cards load instantly with identical resolution and style as the web platform.
- Zero layout shift during search or category navigation.
- All functional paths for booking and inquiry are fully operational and visually premium.
