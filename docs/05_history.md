# 05 History & Agent Progress

## 2026-03-28 - Production Hardening & SSR Security
- **SSR Session Security**: Refactored `AuthContext.tsx` and `bookingService.ts` to instantiate Supabase clients within component/function scope, eliminating cross-request session leakage during SSR.
- **Configurable Storage**: Migrated `lib/image.ts` to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`, removing hardcoded "bucket/" prefixes.
- **Build Stability**: Resolved property mismatches in the Contact page (`mapUrl1` -> `office1MapUrl`) to ensure 100% build success.
- **XSS Mitigation**: Implemented `DOMPurify` sanitization for all content blocks and dynamic HTML fields.

- **UI Simplification**: Streamlined the "Plan My Trip" and "Tailormade" forms by removing non-essential fields (Return Date, Preferred Budget, etc.).
- **Layout Compaction**: Reduced excessive padding and margins across inquiry pages for an elegant, professional look.
- **Branding Excellence**: Generated and integrated a transparent red bird logo variant. Updated Footer typography and social UI colors.
- **Routing Fixes**: Corrected the `Hotels -> Mauritius` link in the navigations table to route to `/hotels/mauritius`.
